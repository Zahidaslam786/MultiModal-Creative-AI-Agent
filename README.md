# 🎨 Multi-Modal Creative AI Agent

A sophisticated AI system capable of bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual intelligence. This project integrates **Image Synthesis** and **Vision Analysis** into a single cohesive agentic workflow.

## 🚀 Overview
This agent functions as both a creator and an observer. It can synthesize high-fidelity images from complex prompts and then "see" and analyze those images to provide structured descriptive feedback.

## 🛠️ The Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. **Latent Diffusion Synthesis**: The agent utilizes a **Stable Diffusion** pipeline (comprising a Text Encoder, UNet, and VAE) to generate 512x512 artistic images.
2. **Visual Perception**: A **Vision-Language Model** is used to interpret the generated output, describing objects, styles, and composition.
3. **Hardware Optimization**: The system is specifically optimized to run on **T4 GPUs** using `float16` precision and the `accelerate` library for high-speed inference.

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frameworks**: Hugging Face Diffusers & Transformers.
- **Core Library**: PyTorch.
- **Optimization**: Accelerate for efficient GPU memory management.
- **Models**: Free, Open-Source Stable Diffusion and Vision Transformers.

## 📊 Visual Gallery
Below are samples of images generated by the agent along with its autonomous vision analysis.
