# 🎨 Multi-Modal Creative AI Agent

A sophisticated AI system designed to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and visual intelligence. This project integrates **Image Synthesis** and **Visual Perception** into a single cohesive agentic workflow.

## 🚀 Overview
This agent functions as both a creator and an observer. It can synthesize high-fidelity images from complex prompts and then "see" and analyze those images to provide structured descriptive feedback. This demonstrates the power of multi-modal AI in creative and analytical pipelines.

## 🛠️ The Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. **Latent Diffusion Synthesis**: The agent utilizes the **Stable Diffusion** pipeline (Text Encoder, UNet, and VAE) to generate high-quality images from text descriptions.
2. **Visual Perception & Analysis**: Using **Vision-Language Models** (like BLIP), the agent interprets the generated output, autonomously describing objects, styles, and artistic composition.
3. **Hardware & Inference Optimization**: The system is specifically optimized to run on **T4 GPUs** using `float16` precision and the `accelerate` library for high-speed, memory-efficient inference.
4. **End-to-End Pipeline**: A unified Python interface that handles the transition from text-to-image and image-to-text without manual intervention.

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frameworks**: Hugging Face Diffusers & Transformers.
- **Core Library**: PyTorch.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Accelerate for efficient GPU memory management.
- **Modality**: Multi-modal (Text + Vision).
